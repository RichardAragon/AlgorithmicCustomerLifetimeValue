# Algorithmic Customer Lifetime Value
Calculates the CLV of a customer by converting the Customer Lifecycle into a mathematical equation, then running customer attributes through the algorithm.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) = Customer Value * Customer Lifespan
Customer Value can be calculated using the following formula:

Customer Value = (Average Revenue per Customer - Average Cost per Customer) * Customer Retention Rate

Customer Lifespan can be calculated using the following formula:

Customer Lifespan = Average Number of Purchases per Customer / Customer Churn Rate
Customer Retention Rate can be calculated using the following formula:

Customer Retention Rate = (Number of Customers at the End of the Period - Number of New Customers Acquired During the Period) / Number of Customers at the Beginning of the Period

Customer Churn Rate can be calculated using the following formula:

Customer Churn Rate = (Number of Customers Lost During the Period / Number of Customers at the Beginning of the Period) * 100%

These four formulas can be used to calculate the CLV of each customer, which can then be used to make decisions about how to allocate marketing resources and improve customer relationships.

For example, if you know that a particular customer has a high CLV, you may want to invest more in marketing to that customer or offer them special discounts and incentives to keep them coming back.

On the other hand, if you know that a particular customer has a low CLV, you may want to focus your marketing efforts on other customers.

By using these formulas to calculate the CLV of each customer, you can make more informed decisions about how to allocate your marketing resources and improve your overall customer lifecycle management strategy.
